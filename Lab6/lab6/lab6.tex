\makeatletter
%%The \makeatletter command temporarily defines »@« as a normal character to enable changes to internal LaTeX macros outside packages (STY) or classes (CLS).
\let\thetitle\@title
%%\let allows you to copy the content of a command into a new command.
\let\theauthor\@author
%%Thus \let\foo\bar defines \foo to have the value that \bar had at the point of definition.
\makeatother
% With \makeatother this process is reversed and the »@« is set to its original character category (other). The »@« is used to protect the internal LaTeX macros. Hence you should be very careful when using these two commands.
\pagestyle{fancy}
%%After that, the "fancy" style is set by \pagestyle{fancy}
\fancyhf{}
%%The command \fancyhf{} clears the header and footer, otherwise the elements of the default "plain" page style will appear. 
\rhead{\theauthor}
%%Prints the text included inside the braces on the right side of the header. 
\lhead{\thetitle}
%%Prints the text set inside the braces on the left side of the header.

%%\cfoot{Page \thepage}  Prints the word "Page" and next the page number which is automatically set by \thepage on the center of the footer.

        \subsection*{Task Realization:}
        In Figure 1 Is the result of Finding Max Number, I used 2 If statements to find that number.
        \begin{figure}[H]
                \centering
                \includegraphics[width=.3\textwidth]{img1.png}
                \caption{Finding Max number Using IF-Else}
        \end{figure}
        \vspace{0.5 cm}
        
        To Solve Next Task i Used WHILE statement, and i incremented the counter from 1 to 10 and printed each line one by one. Also I used variable to store the ID of the discipline "Baze de date".
        \begin{figure}[H]
                \centering
                \includegraphics[width=.9\textwidth]{img2.png}
                \caption{Top 10 Students, ad their marks}
        \end{figure}
        \vspace{0.5 cm}

        For this Task I used Case one statement. It Has Two decision making branches for b1 max and b2 max, and  ELSE case when none of n1 or n2 are greater than n3
        \begin{figure}[H]
                \centering
                \includegraphics[width=0.3\textwidth]{img3.png}
                \caption{Finding Max Number Using CASE}
        \end{figure}
        \vspace{0.5 cm}

        Here I customized the way of selecting random number, so now i create two integer random numbers  in the interval -5 to 5 and divide them one by another. In these way i hope i increase the randomization, But the second number can be 0. So i Try to catch Zero Division Error.
        \begin{figure}[H]
                \centering
                \includegraphics[width=.95\textwidth]{img4.png}
                \caption{Try Catch Block }
        \end{figure}
        \vspace{0.5 cm}

        In Last Task I did my own custom Error, and i try to catch that error. So in case when it cant find the ID of the discipline it means that it was inserted with some mistakes.
        \begin{figure}[H]
                \centering
                \includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{img5.png}
                \caption{Custom Raise Error inside Try Catch Block }
        \end{figure}
        \vspace{0.5 cm}



        \newpage 
        \subsection*{Conclusion}
        During This lab work i find out how to define and Use System and custom/user's variables. I gained skills with Control-Flow Operands like If-Else or Case. Also I figured out how to handle exceptions in my SQL code.
