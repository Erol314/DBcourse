\makeatletter
%%The \makeatletter command temporarily defines »@« as a normal character to enable changes to internal LaTeX macros outside packages (STY) or classes (CLS).
\let\thetitle\@title
%%\let allows you to copy the content of a command into a new command.
\let\theauthor\@author
%%Thus \let\foo\bar defines \foo to have the value that \bar had at the point of definition.
\makeatother
% With \makeatother this process is reversed and the »@« is set to its original character category (other). The »@« is used to protect the internal LaTeX macros. Hence you should be very careful when using these two commands.
\pagestyle{fancy}
%%After that, the "fancy" style is set by \pagestyle{fancy}
\fancyhf{}
%%The command \fancyhf{} clears the header and footer, otherwise the elements of the default "plain" page style will appear. 
\rhead{\theauthor}
%%Prints the text included inside the braces on the right side of the header. 
\lhead{\thetitle}
%%Prints the text set inside the braces on the left side of the header.
\cfoot{\thepage}
%%\cfoot{Page \thepage}  Prints the word "Page" and next the page number which is automatically set by \thepage on the center of the footer.

                %% Importing a graphic is done by using the command \includegraphics[key1=...,key2=...,etc.]{ﬁlename} Optional parameters—called “keys”—enable the figure to be resized, rotated, cropped, trimmed, etc. These keys and their functions are listed below. 
                %• scale = number — a magnification factor 
                %• width = length — the width to which the figure should be scaled1
                %• height = length — the height to which the figure should be scaled2 
                %• totalheight = length — height plus depth of figure (to be used if figure is rotated) 
                %• keepaspectratio = true/false — maintains the height/width ratio 
                %• angle = number — angle (in degrees) by which the figure is to be rotated counterclockwise 
                %• origin = location3 — the point about which rotation is to occur %• draft = true/false — prevents figure from being imported, but created a named box with the dimensions of the figure (this option is used to speed up processing) 
                %• clip = true/false — excludes whatever is outside the bounding box
